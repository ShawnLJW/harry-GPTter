# harry-GPoTter

A simple language model that generates harry potter books.

## About this project

harry-GPoTter is a transformer-based text generation model that I trained from scratch (with reference to this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by Andrej Karpathy).

## Dataset

This model was trained on text from all 7 books from the Harry Potter series. The files were downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/harry-potter-books-corpora-part-1-7).
